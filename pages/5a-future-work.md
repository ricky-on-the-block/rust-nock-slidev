# Future Work

While this was mostly an educational exercise, there are many available routes for future work:

<v-clicks>

- Implement an iterative solution instead of a recursive solution
- Support arbitrarily large unsigned integer inside of `Atom`
- Add a true parser for input `Nouns`
- Dynamically multithread based on workload
- Implement Jet handling
- Benchmark a raw pointer implementation - <u>not</u> idiomatic Rust
- Add bitwise serialization / deserialization to `Noun`s
- Add caching for `Noun` storage, using some type of lazily hashed data structure for lookups
