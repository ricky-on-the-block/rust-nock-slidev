# Future of Urbit

<v-clicks>

- Urbit Foundation recently had a shakeup in their leadership, bringing in a "wartime CEO"
- I believe this just means they are running out of money
- They seem to be talking about ways to tokenize the project to bring financial incentives to early adopters
- Urbit as an Operating System occupies an interesting part of the design space due to its pure functional basis
- Time will tell if it turns into something that achieves adoption like early unix and linux
